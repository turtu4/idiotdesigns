      <p>Common Grounds explores the sibling relationship between a child diagnosed with autism and their neurotypical sibling through storytelling, drawing, and collaborative creation. Using co-design methods, the project encourages both children to build a shared narrative, strengthening their understanding of each other.</p>
      <p>Through structured workshops, the children engage in storytelling techniques inspired by Carol Gray’s Social Stories and Tsao and McCabe’s Protocol. These methods help bridge differences by providing opportunities for self-expression and collaborative imagination. Elements such as drawing, technical illustration, and narrative-building are integrated to make the process engaging and immersive.</p>
      <p>The project also challenges conventional views on autism by positioning neurodivergent children as active creators rather than passive subjects. Common Grounds ultimately seeks to demonstrate how co-design can foster empathy, communication, and deeper familial connections through creative collaboration.</p>
