      <p>Overthinker, or Pestegandire is a meme page with over 100 posts about insecurities. The theme is rendered through doodles made with the mouse accompanied by awkward, sad, or wholesome situations described vividly, yet with a pinch of anxiety. This instagram page gained a local popularity within Romanian youths that related most to the need of reassurance from friends and family.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, under the umbrella of a similar drawing style and trembled atmosphere, I have also developed a story-line-based projection of such emotions. The contrast between performative toughness and apologetic melancholia invokes stress and intensifies dynamism.</p>
      <p>El Dansatoré is a digital comic book created for Instagram, blending a parody of the wrestling industry with a deep dive into locker room dynamics between wrestlers. The story follows a character inspired by Lucha Libre masked wrestlers, focusing on his emotional struggle with crippling panic attacks that forced him to retire from wrestling. Years later, El Dansatoré returns for one final appearance in a 30-man battle royal, inspired by the WWE Royal Rumble. Overwhelmed with nerves, things quickly spiral out of control, blending humor with a raw portrayal of anxiety in the world of professional wrestling.</p>
