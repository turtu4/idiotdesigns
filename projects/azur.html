      <p>Azur Foundation is a Speculative Design project that encompasses the branch of the private medical system dedicated to simulation over-exposure. This sci-fi world involves the political and moral implications of simulation embedment within society. I borrow the voices of characters to give a tint of subjectivity to each frame picture of this reality. Their voices are later weighed over by a more objective overview written from the perspective of a neurologist.</p>
      <p>The story is not about what is wrong and what is right, but rather about transparency and resilience. Regardless of the dystopian technological "advancement", the feelings of despair and segregation from a normal society are not alien to the world we live in today, and can clearly be projected upon bluntly exposed dilemmas.</p>
