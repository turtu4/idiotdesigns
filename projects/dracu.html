      <p>Dracu' is a special kind of journal that depicts challenges and aspirations through sequential sketching as a medium. Comics have a clear form of depicting character development. The composition is regarded as an extension of emotions, each panel communicating the balance or tension attributed to the scene.</p>
      <p>The clash of visual styles denotes a highly exposed lack of certainty, since the story follows a chase for self security. The quasi-inconsistence displays the fragile causality behind this grey-scale and atonal collection of reflections.</p>
      <p>But who is Dracu'? Gheorghe Dracu, in fact, makes his way from my early years of childhood, when my older cousin used to tell me scary stories. The premise implied that a villager was haunted by demons. Over time, Gheorghe started giving into their persuasive demands until he became ill-minded and ultimately a satanic threat to the community. Instead of a crowd of devils, my depiction of self deals with only one. With time, the bizarro pharmakon finds balance with the character through which I portray myself.</p>
