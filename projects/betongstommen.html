      <p>Betongstommen reimagines playground design by integrating risk and autonomy into children’s play. Inspired by Tim Gill’s No Fear: Growing up in a Risk Averse Society, it challenges conventional safety measures and emphasizes the value of calculated risks in child development.</p>
      <p>Central to Betongstommen’s design philosophy is the idea that true safety comes not from eliminating all risks, but from equipping children with the ability to assess and manage them. The concrete structures are deliberately varied in scale and complexity, offering different levels of challenge suited to a range of ages and abilities. This layered approach supports developmental progression, allowing children to return to the same space and engage with it in new ways as their skills and confidence grow. By avoiding prescriptive play elements and instead presenting abstract forms, Betongstommen encourages imaginative interpretation—transforming a slope into a mountain, a gap into a canyon, or a ledge into a stage. In doing so, it nurtures not only physical agility but also creativity and resilience, essential traits for navigating the broader world.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional playgrounds with fences and soft surfaces, Betongstommen embraces open-ended play, using concrete to create a landscape of gradual heights, slopes, and modular forms. These features encourage children to explore, climb, and navigate space independently, fostering confidence and problem-solving skills.</p>
      <p>By rethinking parental perceptions of safety, Betongstommen aims to balance challenge with security, ensuring a dynamic, engaging environment where children lead their own play experiences.</p>
