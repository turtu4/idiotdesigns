      <p>The relationship between two instances embodies the nature of one, well-rounded experience of transition and acceptance. At times there have been entire months between the first and second shot on each individual frame; while on other occasions I have just reloaded the film right after exposing it once. Are the shots plain keystones? Perhaps, just the frames of whatever your imagination dwells you into when you are pondering on what could have happened from one photo session to another? Is the story in the contrast of two moments or the vague process between them?</p>
      <p>Either way, it is a lot cheaper to do analogue photography like this.</p>
