# idiotdesigns Portfolio Website

Welcome to the idiotdesigns portfolio workspace! This project will showcase creative work, experiments, and personal branding for the idiotdesigns portfolio website. As the codebase evolves, document unique design choices, workflows, and conventions here to help future AI agents and contributors be immediately productive.

## Minimalist Brutalist Webdesign Template

A starter template is provided in `src/` for a minimalist brutalist portfolio site. Key files:
- `src/index.html`: Main HTML structure, header, project list, and footer
- `src/style.css`: Brutalist, high-contrast, accessible styles
- `src/main.js`: Loads and displays 12 accessible projects

### Accessible Projects List

# Copilot Instructions for idiotdesigns

## Project Overview
This workspace currently contains minimal structure and no discoverable code, documentation, or conventions. The only file present is `idiotdesigns.code-workspace`, which defines the VS Code workspace folder.

## Guidance for AI Coding Agents
- There are no source files, build scripts, tests, or documentation detected. Before making assumptions, confirm the intended project type and structure with the user.
- If starting a new project, prompt the user for their preferred language, framework, and any architectural requirements.
- When new files or folders are added, update this document to reflect project-specific conventions, workflows, and integration points.
- If you find a README, build scripts, or configuration files, summarize their key patterns and workflows here.
- Use this file to document any unique conventions, naming schemes, or integration details as the project evolves.

## Next Steps
- Ask the user for details about the intended project structure, language, and goals.
- Once code or documentation is present, update this file to provide actionable, project-specific instructions for future AI agents.
